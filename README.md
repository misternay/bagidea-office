# BagIdea AI Agents Office

> **A living AI Agent Office Simulation that runs as your desktop wallpaper.**
> Every AI agent on your machine becomes a character in an HD-2D office — they walk to their desks when real work starts, gather at Security to ask for permission, hold meetings, learn skills, and the lights follow your real local time.

Not a dashboard. Not a chat window. A **world** that renders the true state of your AI agents — Claude Code sessions, headless agent runs, custom scripts — as living pixel-art employees, behind your desktop icons.

![Sci-fi office on the night shift](shots/scifi_office.png)
*Real local time — agents work glowing consoles in a sci-fi office in a countryside meadow, clouds drifting by, the camera slowly breathing. Desktop icons render on top: this is a real wallpaper.*

> ⚠️ **Status: working product (Windows 11).** The full pipeline works end-to-end: wallpaper → daemon → real Claude Code sessions → spatialized approvals → agent management UI. Some art packs are not bundled (licenses — see [Art assets](#art-assets)); the game falls back to procedural placeholders without them.

## What it does

### 🖥️ Live wallpaper world (Layer 1 — Godot 4)
- Renders **behind your desktop icons** (WorkerW technique, same as Wallpaper Engine)
- HD-2D look: 3D office + billboarded pixel-art sprites lit by the scene, sky-driven image-based lighting, SSR-polished reflective floors, a cinematic tilt-shift focus pass (breathing vignette, edge desaturation, anamorphic bars), film grain, native-res MSAA
- **10 zones**: Executive Office, Operations Floor (6 desks), Lobby, Cafeteria, Security Center, Meeting Room, Server Room, two Dormitories (8 bunks — offline agents walk to a bed and sleep, they never just vanish), and a **Recreation Room** with a TV corner, chess, a hydroponics garden, a wandering pixel dog 🐕 and a self-kicking football ⚽
- A **countryside** around the office: 4,200 blades of wind-swaying grass, low-poly mountains and trees, drifting cartoon clouds (a near layer actually crosses the camera frame), bird flocks, daytime pollen motes and fireflies at night
- Agents **walk** between zones on an A* waypoint graph with 4-direction animated spritesheets; facing follows movement
- **Real-time day/night cycle** — sun, sky color, ambient and reflections follow your machine's clock (sunset ~17:00, night by 18:00); manual override from the overlay (🌗) for golden-hour screenshots
- A **roofline digital clock** with a phase icon (sun ☀ / low sun 🌇 / crescent moon 🌙) next to the brand billboard
- **MMO-style nameplates** on a crisp 2D HUD: portrait, name, role/status, live state pill (IDLE/WORKING/MEETING/BLOCKED/OFFLINE), distance-scaled — with **rank dressing**: the CEO's plate is gold with a pixel crown, the Director's is bright blue with a lead star
- **Event FX**: pixel-art flipbooks pop above characters — ✅ on task done, ❌ on failure, ❗ at Security, 👍/👎 on decisions, 🎵 when speaking, golden burst on a new skill, sci-fi warps on hire/fire
- **Equippable auras**: an elemental magic ring (fire/ice/nature/arcane/shadow/gold) under any character, picked in the agent editor — the CEO can wear one too
- **The Ghost Deck**: a floating glass platform above the east wing with 8 desks — when an agent splits into sub-agents, translucent **ghost clones** of it materialize, float up through the roof (no stairs — they're ghosts), work at a desk with live status plates, then glide home and dissolve back into their owner
- The idle **Director makes rounds** through the office instead of standing still; the CEO paces the executive floor (that's you)
- **Mission Control board** in-world: one card per running task, colored by state; lobby status totem shows daemon connectivity (truth, not decoration)
- Branded boot: a transparent floating logo splash + a pulsing circular logo card — never a black box

### 🔌 Event daemon (Layer 0 — Node.js, zero dependencies)
- WebSocket event hub — the Godot world and the overlay UI subscribe to one stream
- **Event journal** (`journal.jsonl`) with replay on connect: restart anything, state comes back
- **Agent registry** (`registry.json`): persistent staff — name, job title, avatar, aura, system prompt, skills, tools. `main` (the Director — Claude itself) and `ceo` (you) are protected and cannot be deleted
- **Claude Code adapter**: `POST /chat` spawns a real headless `claude -p` session with the agent's persona, assigned skills and allowed tools; stream-json output becomes world events
- **Chat threads**: every conversation is a named, resumable session (`--resume`) with its own recorded history; agents keep continuous memory by default
- **Skills library** with **Hermes-style auto-learning**: after a completed multi-tool task, a reflection pass decides whether the work distills into a reusable skill — if so it's saved, auto-assigned, and announced in the office
- **Tools**: per-agent allowlist over the built-in Claude Code tools, plus custom capability via **MCP servers** (name + launch command → injected with `--mcp-config`)
- **CEO chain of command**: ordering the CEO summons the Director — he walks over, takes the order, replies with a plan, and dispatches work to teammates via `DELEGATE:` lines (each spawns a real session, with the hand-over walk acted out). Delegation is a **round trip**: every delegate's result is reported back to the Director, who can answer questions / follow up with more `DELEGATE:` lines (bounded depth, serialized turns), and finally walks the CEO-readable summary over to the boss (`ceo.report`)
- **Agent discussions**: pick 2–4 agents and a topic — they hold a real meeting, round-robin turns over a shared transcript, minutes on the in-world whiteboard
- **Self-splitting sub-agents**: every session is told it may end a reply with `SUB: <job>` lines (2–4) when the request parallelizes — the daemon strips the protocol, spawns parallel clone sessions with the parent's persona + tools, records each in a labeled 👻 session, and resumes the parent for a final synthesis once all ghosts report back (a stuck ghost is reaped after 6 min, so synthesis always happens)
- **Claude Code hooks integration**: any Claude Code session in this project reports its tool calls — your real work animates the Director automatically
- **Permission broker**: dangerous tools from adapter sessions are held until you approve
- **Replay Theater**: `POST /replay` re-enacts the last N minutes time-compressed, in sepia

### 🛡️ Spatialized security
When an agent needs a dangerous tool:
1. Its character **physically walks to the Security Center** and waits (amber light pulses, ❗ flashes over its head)
2. The overlay's Security Center pops open with the **exact command**
3. You click **Allow / Deny** — deny (or 50s timeout) makes the agent visibly re-plan
4. Approve, and the tool actually executes

This is real: the PreToolUse hook long-polls the daemon until you decide.

### 💬 Overlay (Layer 2)
Served by the daemon at `http://127.0.0.1:8787/` — best experienced through the included **native Rust shell**:
- **Agent rail**: every staff member with live state dots — 👑 the CEO leads in gold (that seat is you), ⭐ the Director in blue; double-click any seat for an **ID card**
- **⚙ Office Settings**: hire/edit/delete agents (12-face avatar picker, aura picker, job titles), a **✨ prompt copilot** (type a one-line brief in any language → a drafted system prompt), skills library with the auto-learn toggle, built-in tool catalog + MCP servers, and a thread manager
- **🗺 Live map**: a real orthographic floorplan render with live agent icons (face, state ring, name) — click one to chat with it
- **🧵 Threads**: per-conversation chat panes — switching threads or agents loads that conversation's history; a thread bar shows where you are; meetings (🗣 with participant faces) and sub-agent jobs (👻 with the owner's face + ✓/✗/⏳ status) are readable forever, streaming live while they run
- **🗣 Discussions**: launch agent-to-agent meetings
- **🌗 Atmosphere picker**, **⏪ Replay**, collapsible **🛡 Security/Mission sidebar** with a pending-count badge that summons itself when an approval arrives
- Circular **chat head** (Messenger-style, never steals focus) + system tray (Start with Windows, Exit)

```

Three independent processes: the **daemon** keeps agents running even if rendering dies; the **renderer** can crash/restart and rebuild from the journal + registry; the **overlay** is just a web client. Truth lives in the daemon; the world is a renderer of truth.

## Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| OS | Windows 11 (wallpaper embedding uses WorkerW; macOS/Linux planned) |
| Renderer | [Godot 4.6+](https://godotengine.org/download) (standard build) |
| Daemon | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+ (no npm packages needed) |
| Agent | [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.com/claude-code) (`claude --version` ≥ 2.x) |
| Shell | Rust toolchain (`cargo`) — or use a browser for the overlay |
| GPU | Anything Vulkan-capable; verified on GTX 1060 6GB |

## Installation

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/bagidea/bagidea-ai-agents-office.git
cd bagidea-ai-agents-office
```

**1. Fix absolute paths** (one-time): the hook configs reference absolute paths. Update these to your clone location:

- `.claude/settings.json` — 3× path to `daemon\hook.ps1`
- `workspace/.claude/settings.json` — 1× path to `daemon\perm.ps1`

**2. Build the shell:**

```powershell
cd shell
cargo build --release   # → shell/target/release/bagidea-office-shell.exe
```

## Art assets

One pack is bundled; three are not (third-party licenses). Everything loads at
runtime — no Godot import step — and **the game still runs without them**,
falling back to procedural placeholder visuals.

**Bundled** ✓ — [Elemental Magic FX by Binbun3D](https://binbun3d.itch.io/elemental-magic-fx) (CC0): the equippable aura rings.

**Characters** — [Customizable Characters Top-Down 32x32 by Schwarnhild](https://schwarnhild.itch.io/customizable-characters-top-down-32x32):

```
godot/assets/characters/
├── npc/      ← contents of premade-npc-spritesheets.zip  (npc1.png … npc12.png)
└── layers/   ← contents of demo-character-idle.zip
```

**Environment** — [Molten Maps SciFi Asset Pack](https://moltenmaps.itch.io/molten-maps-scifi-pack):

```
godot/assets/scifi/   ← all .glb files from the pack's Assets/gtlf folder
```

**Countryside** — a low-poly environment pack (FBX, runtime FBXDocument):

```
godot/assets/env/     ← Mounting_*.fbx, Tree_*.fbx, Rock_*.fbx, Bush_*.fbx, …
```

**Event FX** — [Super Pixel Effects Gigapack (Free) by untiedgames](https://untiedgames.itch.io/super-pixel-effects-gigapack):
copy these `spritesheet.png` files from the pack's `spritesheet/` tree into
`godot/assets/pixelfx/`, renamed as follows:

| File | From pack folder |
|---|---|
| `success.png` | `symbol_success_001_small_green` |
| `failure.png` | `symbol_failure_001_small_red` |
| `alert.png` | `symbol_alert_001_small_red` |
| `warning.png` | `symbol_warning_001_small_yellow` |
| `thumbs_up.png` / `thumbs_down.png` | `symbol_thumbs_up/down_001_small_*` |
| `warp_in.png` / `warp_out.png` | `scifi_warp_001_small_green` / `scifi_warp_002_small_red` |
| `heart.png` | `round_heart_burst_001_small_red` |
| `sparkle.png` / `sparkle_green.png` | `round_sparkle_burst_001/002_small_*` |
| `light_burst.png` | `round_light_burst_001_small_yellow` |
| `music.png` | `directional_music_burst_002_small_yellow` |

## Running the full stack

**One exe runs everything:**

```powershell
.\shell\target\release\bagidea-office-shell.exe
```

The shell spawns the daemon, launches the Godot office (hidden behind a pulsing
logo splash until the first frame renders), embeds it behind your desktop icons,
then brings in the chat head and the tray icon. A second launch exits instantly
(single-instance mutex). Set `BAGIDEA_GODOT` if your Godot binary lives somewhere
other than `E:\Tools\Godot\Godot_v4.6.3-stable_win64.exe`.

- **Chat head**: circular, draggable, never steals focus; click = show/hide the overlay
- **System tray**: left-click toggles the chat; menu has **Start with Windows**
  and **Exit BagIdea Office** — the only true exit (tears the stack down and
  restores your wallpaper)

Manual/dev mode still works:

```powershell
node daemon\server.js
# windowed: open the Godot project normally
# screenshot: godot --path godot -- --shot --hour=13 --cloudtest
```

## Using it

### Hire your team
⚙ → AGENTS → **Hire a new agent**: pick one of 12 faces, an aura, a job title,
then either write the system prompt yourself or type a one-line brief
(any language) and hit **✨ Draft** — a real Claude call writes the persona.
Assign skills and tools with chips. Everything is editable later; deleting an
agent warps them out of the office. `main` and `ceo` are protected.

### Chat
Click a face in the rail (or on the 🗺 map) and type. Each agent keeps
continuous memory; use 🧵 to start a fresh thread or jump back into an old one —
the pane shows that conversation's history. Threads are managed (and deletable)
under ⚙ → THREADS.

### Command through the CEO
Type into the **CEO seat** (the gold one — that's you): the Director walks over,
takes your order, answers with a plan, and delegates real work to the team —
watch the hand-offs happen on the wallpaper.

### Let them talk to each other
🗣 → pick 2–4 agents + a topic + rounds: they gather in the meeting room and
discuss over a shared transcript; minutes land on the in-world whiteboard.

### Watch your own Claude Code sessions
Any Claude Code session inside this project reports its prompts and tool calls
through hooks — the **Director** works at his desk in real time while you work.

### Approve dangerous tools
When a session needs Bash/Write/etc., its character walks to Security and the
overlay pops the exact command with Allow/Deny.

### Simulate events (no Claude needed)
```powershell
node daemon\send.js task.started rin
node daemon\send.js perm.requested rin
node daemon\send.js task.completed rin
node daemon\send.js agent.offline rin
```

## HTTP API

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /chat` `{agent, prompt, session?}` | run a real session (`session:"new"` forks a thread) |
| `GET /sessions?agent=` · `GET /sessions/log?agent=&key=` · `POST /sessions/delete` | threads |
| `GET /registry` · `POST /registry/agent` · `POST /registry/agent/delete` | staff CRUD |
| `POST /registry/role` · `/registry/skill` · `/registry/mcp` · `/registry/autoskills` | libraries |
| `POST /assist/prompt` `{name, role, brief}` | ✨ prompt copilot |
| `POST /discuss` `{agents[], topic, rounds}` | agent-to-agent meeting |
| `POST /ui/daylight` `{hour: 17.5 \| "auto"}` | atmosphere override |
| `POST /replay` `{minutes, speed}` | Replay Theater |
| `POST /event` | push any OEP event (custom integrations) |
| `GET /map/bg` · `POST /pos` | live map plumbing |
| `POST /perm/request` (long-poll) · `POST /perm/respond` | permission broker |
| `GET /health` | liveness |

## Event protocol (OEP)

One JSON event per WebSocket message / journal line: `{type, agent, task?, tool?, text?, session?, ts}`.

| Type | World reaction |
|---|---|
| `agent.online` / `agent.offline` | walks in via the entrance / walks to a bunk and sleeps |
| `task.started` / `task.progress` / `task.completed` / `task.failed` | desk + board card; ✅/❌ FX |
| `perm.requested` / `perm.approved` / `perm.denied` | Security walk + ❗; 👍/👎 |
| `chat.message` | speech-bubble status + 🎵 + thread history |
| `collab.started` / `collab.ended` (`agents[]`) | meeting table + whiteboard minutes |
| `subagent.split` / `.spawned` / `.progress` / `.done` (`sub`) | ghost clones float up to the Ghost Deck, work, dissolve back |
| `skill.created` | golden burst + "📚 learned" |
| `ceo.summon` / `task.delegated` | the Director's chain-of-command walks |
| `roster.sync` / `roster.removed` | registry → world (spawn/update/despawn) |
| `ui.daylight` | atmosphere override |
| `theater.started` / `theater.ended` | Replay Theater sepia |

Push your own events from anything: `POST /event` — that's the whole integration
story for custom agents. New WS clients receive a journal replay plus a fresh
roster snapshot.

## Performance

Wallpaper rung: 30 fps cap, native-res render + MSAA 2×, SSR trimmed, volumetrics
replaced by god-ray cards, no SSAO/DOF. On a GTX 1060 @1680×1050 the full scene
(countryside, grass field, clouds, cinematic pass) measures roughly 20–30% GPU —
the renderer pauses entirely when occluded by fullscreen apps. Plenty of knobs
remain (FSR scale, grass density, cinema pass) if you want it leaner.

## Design documents

The `docs/` folder is a complete V1 product-design specification written before
the first line of code — 14-zone world design, agent behavior simulation
(honesty contract: *nothing tagged is fake*), scaling to 100+ agents,
progression, monetization, and the competitive thesis
([doc 10](docs/10-revolutionary-features.md): *"cockpits make agents usable;
this makes them employable"*).

## Roadmap
